# PDF Generation Setup Instructions

## Current Status

PDF generation is currently using a fallback HTML print version. To enable full PDF generation, you need to install the DomPDF package.

## Installation Steps

### Option 1: Using Composer (Recommended)

If you have Composer installed and accessible:

```bash
cd gf
composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If Composer is not accessible via command line:

1. **Add to composer.json** (already done):

    ```json
    "barryvdh/laravel-dompdf": "^2.0"
    ```

2. **Run composer update** using XAMPP:

    ```bash
    C:\xampp\php\php.exe C:\xampp\composer\composer.phar update
    ```

3. **Or download manually**:
    - Go to: https://packagist.org/packages/barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
    - Download the package
    - Extract to `vendor/barryvdh/laravel-dompdf/`

### Option 3: Using XAMPP Control Panel

1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Go to "Shell" tab
3. Run: `composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf`

## After Installation

### Publish Configuration (Optional)

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Barryvdh\DomPDF\ServiceProvider"
```

### Verify Installation

The system will automatically detect if DomPDF is installed and enable PDF generation. No additional configuration is needed.

## Current Fallback Solution

Until DomPDF is installed, the system provides:

-   âœ… **HTML Print Version**: Beautiful, print-friendly ticket layout
-   âœ… **QR Code Generation**: Working QR codes for verification
-   âœ… **Email Attachments**: Calendar invites (.ics files)
-   âœ… **Print Instructions**: Clear guidance for users

## Features Working Now

### âœ… Working Features:

-   Event registration

-   HTML print version of tickets
-   Calendar invite attachments
-   QR code scanning

### ðŸ”„ Will be Enhanced with DomPDF:

## Testing

1. **Register for an event** at `/events/{id}/register`
2. **Check your email** for the confirmation
3. **Click "Download PDF Ticket"** - you'll get the HTML print version
4. **Use Ctrl+P** to print/save as PDF from your browser

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that PHP extensions are enabled: `mbstring`, `dom`, `xml`
2. Ensure write permissions on `storage/` directory
3. Check Laravel logs in `storage/logs/laravel.log`

## Manual PDF Generation (Alternative)

If DomPDF installation fails, you can use the HTML print version:

1. Open the ticket verification page
2. Click "Download PDF Ticket"
3. Use your browser's "Print to PDF" function
4. Save the file

This provides the same functionality with professional formatting.
